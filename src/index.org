* Presentation 
  Please find the [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTFrGFqQntwqI1R5SeuAJOZOurBt72ZKbPEv98xgPWTRfg_Aak5J3-L7y9m82zL-v3N56dCfKeYyCz2/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000][presentation link]] for the entire process captured
  and approved. This presentation has the initial dates when this
  program was proposed to Choppella sir for approval. Later the dates
  have been extended based on the examination schedules in different
  Nodal Centers.

* Process
** Phase 1 - Issue/Bug logging process (Selection of interns)
   [[https://github.com/vlead/outreach-internship-program/blob/develop/src/intern-selection.org][Link for the document]]
** Phase 1 - Validation process by VLEAD team (selection of interns)
   [[https://github.com/vlead/outreach-internship-program/blob/develop/src/phase1-validation.org][Link for the document]]
** Phase 2 - Boot camp plan  
   [[https://github.com/vlead/outreach-internship-program/blob/develop/src/bootcamp-plan.org][Link for the document]]
** Phase 2 - Validation and Review (Selected interns)
   [[https://github.com/vlead/outreach-internship-program/blob/develop/src/phase2-validation.org][Link for the document]]

* Draft Mails 
  [[][Initial Draft mail to call for interns] and [[][Initial Poster]
  [[][Draft mail for the extended deadline of call for interns] and [[][Extended Deadline Poster]
  [[][Draft mail 1 for the reminder of deadline for Application forms]]
  [[][Draft mail 2 for the reminder of deadline for Application forms]]
  [[][Draft mail for intermediate communication related to the ongoing issue raising activity]]
  [[][draft mail for the selected candidates with bootcamp details]]

* Logistics
** Prize Money
   + Phase 1 : Top 10 students would be awarded with prizes based on
     the gravity of issues (severity level, functionality defects
     identified, proposal for enhancements and logical flaws)
     identified/logged after VLEAD team validates and review.
   + Phase 2 : Based on the issues resolved and the total points
     attained (S1:5, S2:3, S3:1), we can have a leaderboard depicting
     all the interns rankwise and award cash prizes/vouchers to the
     top 3 interns every week or so. At the end of the program, every
     intern would at least earn a certificate and others who performed
     well would also earn cash prizes along with the certificates.

** Support during bootcamp
   + IIITH doesn't provide any accomodation facilities during any
     phases of the entire program. Students have to arrange their own
     accomodations in case of outside residentials. NCs have put
     forward an offer of housing the students during phase 2 of the
     program but this is not yet confirmed.
   + Food arrangements would be available based on the payment basis
     in the campus messes/canteens. Lunch would be provided during the
     3 days bootcamp from our side.
   + The weekly review for the interns at IIITH would be scheduled on
     every Wednesday/Thursday from 10:00 a.m. till 4:00 p.m.

* Fallback plans
** A. Calling up MSIT students
   In case we do not the expected response from the college students
   or they do not raise issues which are valid enough for the next
   phase of the program or they are not capable to resolve the issues
   raised, we would try and call MSIT students housed at IIITH itself
   and provide the same perks and advantages to make this program a
   success.
** B. Calling up IIITH students
   In case Plan A also doesn's work out due to unforeseen constraints,
   we would connect with IIITH students itself for this internship
   activity.

* Conclusion
  Based on the issues raised the students would be given an
  opportunity to work as an intern in virtual labs and also contribute
  in a mission mode MHRD project. The labs would be improved as part
  of this program giving us an edge in outreach programs by connecting
  to the different Nodal Coordinators across the state.
