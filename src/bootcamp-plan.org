* Introduction
  This document describes the bootcamp plan for selected students at
  IIITH. VLEAD would be conducting the 3 days bootcamp for the
  students to onboard them for the next 3-4 weeks of the internship
  program. They would be trained on the development/testing
  environments along with the technological dependencies required for
  the labs.

* Plan of action (take from slides and the link in hangouts)
  Day 1 - Development environment, local testing environment
  Day 2 - technological dependencies
  Day 3 - any other details and plan for ahead

* Conclusion
  After the validation process, the issues would be
  finalized and assigned to the students for resolving them.
